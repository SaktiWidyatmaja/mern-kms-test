# MERN Stack Foundation Challenge

This project was created as part of the MERN Stack Foundation Challenge conducted by PT. Ksatria Mitra Solusindo in partnership with Knight Connections Sdn. Bhd. The challenge involved building a web application that combines a React front-end with an Express.js back-end, along with MongoDB as the database.

## Overview

The challenge aimed to build a web application that integrates React, Express.js, and MongoDB. The application is a simple website that displays the user's IP address and keeps track of the number of visits. The website was deployed to Vercel for the Express.js back-end and Firebase for the React front-end.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database.
- Firebase: A platform for building web and mobile applications.
- Vercel: A cloud platform for hosting web applications.
